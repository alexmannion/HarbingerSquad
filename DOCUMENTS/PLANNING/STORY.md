EVENTUALLY HAL IS RESURRECTED AND STATES THAT THERE'S A HUGE PROBLEM, 
THAT JESUS WAS MEANT TO BE RESURRECTED, BUT INSTEAD GOD RESURRECTED HIM.

A DISCUSSION HAPPENS AND IT'S REVEALED THAT HAL MET GOD, AND THROUGH DUMB LUCK LOOKED A LOT LIKE JESUS BUT WHITE, BUT GOD WAS COLOR BLIND 
- CAN VISUALLY DISPLAY THIS BY HAVING THE CAPSULES ON THE SPACESHIP HAVE NAMEPLATES, THE BUTTONS TO FREE JESUS AND HAL WERE JUST NEXT TO EACHOTHER.

WHEN GOD FAILED A QUICKTIME EVENT, THERE WAS A BUG THAT IT'D RESPAWN THE PERSON 1 POD OVER INSTEAD OF RESTARTING. GOD HAD NEVER FAILED A QUICKTIME EVENT SO HE DIDN'T KNOW THIS, AND INSTEAD ASSUMED THAT IT WORKED ANYWAYS.
